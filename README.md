# Shadow Clone System

> **AI-powered master craftsmen working in synchronized excellence**

⚠️ **PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE** - This repository contains proprietary code owned by Ignis AI Labs LLC, a Puerto Rico-based company. Unauthorized use, distribution, or access is strictly prohibited. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for terms.

Orchestrates teams of specialized AI agents that work in parallel waves to deliver exceptional results. Every agent operates at master level - no weak links allowed.

## 🔐 Intellectual Property Protection

Shadow Clone prompts are served dynamically through our secure API:
- **No Local Files**: Prompts are never stored on user machines
- **API Authentication**: Only licensed users can access prompts
- **Encrypted Delivery**: All prompts transmitted via HTTPS
- **Session-Based**: Prompts are ephemeral and session-specific
- **Copy Protection**: Prompts cannot be exported or saved locally

## 🚀 Quick Start

### MCP Server Integration
```bash
# Install MCP Server
npm install -g @shadow-clone/mcp-server

# Configure Claude Desktop
# Add to claude_desktop_config.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shadow-clone": {
      "command": "shadow-clone-mcp"
    }
  }
}

# Use directly in Claude conversations
- Authenticate once with your API key
- Access all Shadow Clone tools immediately
- Deploy agents with simple function calls
```

**Features:**
- Secure prompt delivery (never stored locally)
- NFT-based license verification
- Full Shadow Clone capabilities
- IP protection via compiled prompts

## 🌊 Execution Flow

1. **Analysis** - Project understanding
2. **Team Configuration** - Master assignments
3. **Wave Planning** - Work organization
4. **Parallel Deployment** - Simultaneous execution (max 10/batch)
5. **Mode Execution** - Specialized workflows
6. **Integration** - Quality validation

## 📁 Wave Organization

All deliverables organized by waves:
```
$waves_directory/
├── wave-1/
├── wave-2/
└── FINAL_DELIVERABLES
```

## 🛡️ Quality Standards

- **No Weak Links**: Every agent at master level
- **False Positive Rate**: <10% for findings
- **Expert Consensus**: >95% agreement
- **Multi-Tool Validation**: Cross-referenced results

## 🎮 Usage Examples

```javascript
// Authenticate once per session
authenticate(apiKey: "your-shadow-clone-api-key")

// Deploy full orchestration
shadow_clone_orchestrate(
  mode: "feature",
  projectDescription: "Build a real-time chat system with React and Node.js"
)

// Or use modular tools for focused tasks
quick_fix(
  issueType: "bug",
  description: "Fix login form validation error"
)

// Deploy specialized teams
deploy_agent_team(
  teamType: "frontend",
  task: "Implement responsive dashboard"
)
```

**Note:** All prompts are compiled into the MCP server - never exposed as plain text files.

## 📊 Project Modes

- **Audit**: Comprehensive security assessment (OWASP, NIST, CWE)
- **Feature**: Security-first development with TDD
- **Refactor**: Code improvement preserving security
- **Optimize**: Performance enhancement maintaining security
- **Debug**: Issue resolution and root cause analysis
- **Research**: Technical exploration and prototyping

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Modular Tools
Deploy single agents or teams for focused tasks:
- `deploy_agent_team` - Specialized team deployment (frontend, backend, database, etc.)
- `deploy_specialist_agent` - Single expert agents (react_expert, api_designer, etc.)
- `quick_fix` - Rapid bug fixes
- `code_review_team` - Targeted code reviews
- `generate_tests` - Automated test creation
- `create_documentation` - Documentation generation
- `execute_single_wave` - Single wave execution
- `architecture_consultant` - Expert guidance

### Core Features
- **Native Integration**: Direct function calls via MCP protocol
- **NFT Authentication**: Blockchain-based license verification
- **Embedded Prompts**: All prompts compiled into server (IP protected)
- **Parallel Deployment**: Up to 10 agents per batch

**Remember**: Every agent is a master. No weak links allowed.

## 🧪 Internal Testing (Authorized Personnel Only)

For internal development and testing, authorized personnel can validate the Shadow Clone system:

### Local Testing (Development)
```bash
# Single command that loads the test file AND executes the test
Load {current_dir}/.shadow-local/testing/test_mode.md and execute with mode=plan
```

### API Testing (Production Verification)
```bash
# Single command that loads the test file AND executes the test
Load {current_dir}/.shadow/testing/test_mode.md and execute with mode=feature
```

**Available test modes**: audit, debug, feature, optimize, refactor, research, plan

**Testing workflow**:
1. Make changes locally
2. Test with `--source=local`
3. Deploy to production
4. Test with `--source=api`

This ensures both local development and production API work correctly.
